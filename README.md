# team-profile-generator

## About the Project
Criteria: As a Manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

Using jest to test in the terminal once everything passes we use Inquirer for user data collection. After the data is collected, we have an HTML document that is generated.![Screenshot 2022-03-28 194618](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94206317/160506244-e252fb2b-8751-4c4f-8eda-4e735990d82e.png)
